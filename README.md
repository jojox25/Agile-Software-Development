Assignment 1: Software Engineering Article
------------
The article I used was [What I Learned in My First Two Years as a Software Engineer](https://blog.usejournal.com/what-i-learned-in-my-first-two-years-as-a-software-engineer-4e374fdcf0fd).

I thought this was a *particularly* interesting article because it was someone's personal experience as a young software engineer entering the workforce right after college. The author learned a handful of good lessons that *I* found helpful, since I am considering a job in the same path.
>...The article may be helpful for you all as well.

The **first lesson** he learned was basically to acknowledge that your work-life balance is just as important as being good at what you do. The people you surround yourself with at work should inspire you to learn, be a better person, and grow everyday! *I learned this firsthand* over the summer when I worked as a backend engineer at a small startup, where all my coworkers were super *FUN* and engaging. The **second lesson** is that in order to teach others, you need to know how to guide them to get the answer on their own and not tell them the answer and how to get it. I think this is important as well, and my father (a high school math teacher in Harlem) taught me this my whole life growing up! The **last lesson** is to always ask questions before solving the problem; this makes you a better problem solver already.

Thank you for reading!

This was a great article! One of my favorite lessons he presented was:

*Lesson 3: It is the mark of a great problem solver to ask many questions before beginning to think about a solution*

This lesson is really important and I think many people forget that it's infact a *good* thing to ask a lot of questions. It means that you are actually thinking about something as opposed to not actively thinking at all. Thanks for this great article!
